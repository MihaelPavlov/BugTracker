# Project Description

### Registration
When you register you need to select **register as a user** or **register as a CEO of a company**.
If you choose: 

**User** - you will have to choose which company you will work for. We have a field with all registered companies in our platform from which you will have to choose your company. After completing the registration you will need to wait for your approval from the company. We do this to protect against fake users
(Imagine registering as a user for a company and the company has not hired you at all. This allows the CEO of the company to approve those users only he knows about.)

**Register as a CEO of a company** - you get the administration role of CEO. You will have all permission over your company and projects.

### Roles that we have!
